## Weight Initializer  

Weight initialization is an important consideration in the design of a neural network model.

The nodes in neural networks are composed of parameters referred to as weights used to calculate a weighted sum of the inputs.

Neural network models are fit using an optimization algorithm called stochastic gradient descent that incrementally changes the network weights to minimize a loss function, hopefully resulting in a set of weights for the mode that is capable of making useful predictions.

This optimization algorithm requires a starting point in the space of possible weight values from which to begin the optimization process. Weight initialization is a procedure to set the weights of a neural network to small random values that define the starting point for the optimization (learning or training) of the neural network model.
